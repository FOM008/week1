            <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p>
            I'm a mechanical engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi. <br>
            My current employer is Safaricom PLC where I work at the Technology Division as a TVM. <br>
            My hobbies include <em> playing football and travelling!</em> <br>
            Decided to study programming as a +1 more skill and enhance my computing knowledge during execution of my daily roles.
